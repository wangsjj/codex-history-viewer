# Command Reference

This document lists user-facing command IDs and what each command does.

Notes:

- Labels shown in VS Code can appear in English or Japanese based on your `codexHistoryViewer.ui.language` setting.
- This page focuses on base command IDs (for example, `codexHistoryViewer.search`) and excludes internal UI alias commands (`codexHistoryViewer.ui.*`).

Starting with 2.15.0, the Command Palette groups History and Pinned view options into **Filter...**, **Change Sort Order...**, and **Change Presentation...** commands for each view. Individual sort, layout, project display/scope, source, display-target, tag, and compression choices remain in the pane menus instead of appearing separately in the palette. The existing command IDs listed below remain available for custom keybindings. Clear-filter commands and primary actions such as settings, search, and refresh remain in the palette.

Archived display targets are unavailable when Codex archived sessions are disabled or a view is limited to Claude Code. In those cases, the cycle contains Active Only, Hidden Only, and All.

Compression choices are also available in **Filter History...**. They affect the History target used by Search and History Insights; Pinned retains its own filters. Reading Codex `.jsonl.zst` files requires the experimental **Include compressed Codex histories** setting, which is disabled by default.

## Sorting Commands

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |

## Search Commands

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search... | `codexHistoryViewer.search` | Opens the search input flow and runs a full-text search. |
| Configure Default Search Roles... | `codexHistoryViewer.searchConfigureDefaultRoles` | Selects default roles included in Search. |
| Rerun Search | `codexHistoryViewer.searchRerun` | Re-runs the last query with its saved role and case options against the current History target. |
| Filter Search by Tags... | `codexHistoryViewer.searchFilterByTag` | Updates the History tag filter used as the Search scope. |
| Clear Search Tag Filter | `codexHistoryViewer.clearSearchTagFilter` | Clears the History tag filter used as the Search scope. |
| Run Saved Search... | `codexHistoryViewer.searchRunPreset` | Opens the saved-search picker; selecting an item runs it, and the trash button deletes that saved search. |
| Run from Search History... | `codexHistoryViewer.searchRunRecent` | Selects and reruns a query from the current project's search history. |
| Clear Project Search History... | `codexHistoryViewer.searchClearHistory` | Clears the current project's stored search history after confirmation. |
| Manage Search History... | `codexHistoryViewer.searchManageHistory` | Opens the current project's search history for rerunning or deleting individual queries. |
| Initialize Search Pane | `codexHistoryViewer.searchClearResults` | Clears current Search results and resets the Search root node. |
| Save Current Search... | `codexHistoryViewer.searchSavePreset` | Saves the displayed search query alone or together with the filters used for its results. |

Starting with 2.15.0, saving a search offers **Query only** or **Query and filters**. Filters include date, project, source, display target, tags, and compression. Running a preset with filters reapplies them to History and Search without changing Pinned. Saved dates keep their captured values; query-only presets use the current History filters. Both types use the current role and case-sensitivity settings. A preset that requires disabled sources, archived sessions, or compressed histories cannot run until those settings are enabled; the extension explains the missing requirement without widening the scope.

## Archive Actions

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move to Codex History | `codexHistoryViewer.restoreArchivedSession` | Restores selected archived Codex sessions back to normal Codex History. |
| Move to Archive | `codexHistoryViewer.archiveSession` | Moves selected active Codex sessions to the Codex archive location. |

## File AI Change History

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Show File AI Change History | `codexHistoryViewer.openFileChangeHistory` | Opens AI-related change history for a selected workspace file. |

The **File AI Change History** icon on Session Viewer diff cards opens the same view at the selected change, initially loading up to 100 nearby changes. Use **Load more** for the remaining history. A row combining multiple changes jumps to its first included change; an unavailable match displays a notice. The icon is available on both collapsed and expanded file rows when the target can be resolved to a file in the current workspace, independently of the optional Explorer context-menu setting.

## History Insights and Agent Runs

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Show History Insights | `codexHistoryViewer.showHistoryInsights` | Opens an analytics snapshot for the sessions matching the current History conditions. It is available from the History view header and the Command Palette. |
| Open Parent Session | `codexHistoryViewer.openCodexAgentParent` | Opens the available parent of a selected Codex sub-agent session. When Agent Runs is enabled, this action appears only in the context menu for a sub-agent whose parent can be resolved; it is hidden from the Command Palette. |

Codex automatic approval reviews (Guardian) with explicit parent metadata use the same Agent Runs actions and visibility rules as other Codex agent sessions. Agent Runs remains experimental and disabled by default.

## Session Actions

When editing the last prompt in Codex changes the session file for the same conversation, the open Session Viewer keeps displaying its current JSONL file. Auto-refresh and manual reload continue to use that file. When a newer main history is detected, a notice below the header offers **Go to main history**, and the resume button is replaced by the same action. This also covers a first-prompt edit that creates a standalone JSONL without an inherited history reference. This switches the history displayed inside the viewer. Use the usual resume button after switching to resume through the Codex extension or CLI. The notice is available even when Branch Navigation is disabled; switching to the main history has no Command Palette command.

Custom titles, pins, and hidden state continue to follow the conversation. Notes and tags are copied once to each new main history, while bookmarks and saved positions are inherited only where they still refer to the shared history before the edited prompt. If the main history already has an annotation, its note is kept, including an empty note, and tags are merged. The previous history retains its information; later changes to it are not synchronized to the main history. Existing values and later edits or deletions on the main history take precedence. If the history used as the last inheritance checkpoint has been deleted, the current main history becomes the new starting point without copying older information. Subsequent prompt edits inherit from that point onward. Search, History Insights, and File AI Change History use the conversation's main history. Regular Forks remain separate conversations.

In a Session Viewer displaying a previous history, editing notes or tags updates that history, while custom-title actions update the shared conversation title. An unavailable explicit target does not redirect the action to another open conversation. File AI Change History rechecks the conversation when its main history changes, including when it previously had no matching changes.

When `codexHistoryViewer.branchNavigation.enabled` is enabled, Branch Navigation lets you move between the histories before and after an edit. On cards in the Session Viewer's history selector and previews on the previous/next buttons, **Before edit** and **After edit** identify revisions of the same conversation, while **Fork** identifies a separate conversation. Navigation does not modify the stored session files.

Commands entered in Claude Code's shell mode appear as user messages with a **Terminal input** badge. Their results appear in collapsed **Terminal output** cards.

For history search, commands use the User role. Terminal output uses the Tool role and is included only when `codexHistoryViewer.search.indexToolContent` is set to **Messages + Tool Calls + Results** (`toolCallsAndOutputs`). History Insights counts commands as user requests, excluding their output. **Open Session as Markdown** includes the displayed output, while generated resume excerpts and handoff files omit terminal output. These display and extraction rules leave the original session files unchanged.

Tree context-menu targets follow these rules:

| Scope | Commands | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single session | Resume actions, CLI resume-command preparation, **Handoff to Other AI**, **Session Information**, **Custom Title...** | Always operates on the explicitly right-clicked session. |
| Multi-session | Open in a dedicated tab, open as Markdown, edit tags/note, export, pin/unpin, hide/unhide, promote, delete | Uses the same-view multi-selection only when it contains the right-clicked row; otherwise operates on that row alone. Codex and Claude Code sessions can be mixed. |
| Validated Codex multi-session | Move to Archive, Move to Codex History | Uses the same target rule as other multi-session actions, but rejects the whole selection unless every target is a Codex session in the required archive state. |

Menu availability is based on the right-clicked row. Selections from History, Pinned, and Search are never combined.
Opening multiple sessions requires confirmation and opens at most the first 10 unique sessions.

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open Session in Dedicated Tab | `codexHistoryViewer.openSession` | Opens a selected session in a dedicated tab that is not replaced by later tree selections, or activates an existing matching session tab. |
| Open Session as Markdown | `codexHistoryViewer.openSessionMarkdown` | Opens selected sessions as virtual Markdown transcript documents named `<session display title>.md`. No file is created unless the user explicitly saves one. |
| Copy Quick Prompt | `codexHistoryViewer.copyResumePrompt` | Copies a compact resume prompt from the selected session view. |
| Copy Session ID | `codexHistoryViewer.copySessionId` | Copies the target session's validated resume ID. Available under **Session Information**. |
| Copy Session File Path | `codexHistoryViewer.copySessionFilePath` | Copies the target session file's full path. Available under **Session Information**. |
| Reveal Session File | `codexHistoryViewer.revealSessionFile` | Reveals the target session file in its containing folder. Available under **Session Information**. |
| Resume in Codex | `codexHistoryViewer.resumeSessionInCodex` | Sends the target Codex session to the Codex extension. |
| Resume in Claude Code | `codexHistoryViewer.resumeSessionInClaude` | Opens the target Claude Code session in Claude Code. |
| Prepare Codex CLI Resume Command | `codexHistoryViewer.resumeSessionInCodexCli` | Creates a new terminal at the target session CWD and enters `codex resume <SESSION_ID>` without pressing Enter. |
| Prepare Claude Code CLI Resume Command | `codexHistoryViewer.resumeSessionInClaudeCli` | Creates a new terminal at the target session CWD and enters `claude --resume <SESSION_ID>` without pressing Enter. |
| Promote to Today (Copy) | `codexHistoryViewer.promoteSession` | Copies selected non-archived sessions into today's folder without modifying the originals. |
| Pin | `codexHistoryViewer.pinSession` | Pins selected sessions for quick access. |
| Unpin | `codexHistoryViewer.unpinSession` | Removes selected sessions from Pinned. |
| Hide Sessions | `codexHistoryViewer.hideSessions` | Hides selected sessions from visible-only History, Pinned, and Search results without moving or deleting their source files. |
| Show Sessions | `codexHistoryViewer.unhideSessions` | Makes selected hidden sessions visible again. Use the Hidden Only or All display target to select them. |
| Delete | `codexHistoryViewer.deleteSessions` | Deletes the right-clicked session, or a same-view multi-selection that includes it (trash-first behavior by default). If Codex edit revisions exist, choose **This history only** (**Selected histories only** for multi-selection) or **Before and after edits**. Deleting only the selected JSONL may leave an older revision in the list. Separate Fork conversations remain unless also selected. Referenced history files are protected for either choice. |
| Custom Title... | `codexHistoryViewer.manageCustomTitle` | Opens the shared custom-title picker for setting or clearing a session title. |
| Set Custom Title... | `codexHistoryViewer.setCustomTitle` | Sets an extension-local display title for the selected session. |
| Clear Custom Title | `codexHistoryViewer.clearCustomTitle` | Removes the extension-local custom title from the selected session. |
| Edit Session Tags/Note... | `codexHistoryViewer.editSessionAnnotation` | Edits tags and note annotations for the selected sessions. Multi-session direct editing applies the same tags and note to every target. |

## Handoff Actions

Handoff context-menu actions are shown only when `codexHistoryViewer.handoff.enabled` is enabled. `Delete Handoff Files` remains available from the Control view even when handoff context-menu actions are hidden.

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Handoff to Claude Code | `codexHistoryViewer.handoffToClaude` | Creates or reuses a Codex session handoff file, then opens Claude Code with a prompt that points to it. |
| Create Handoff File | `codexHistoryViewer.createHandoffFile` | Creates or reuses the target session's `handoff.md` without opening another agent. Its completion notification can open the file, copy the handoff prompt, or copy the file's absolute path. |
| Copy Handoff Prompt to Clipboard | `codexHistoryViewer.copyHandoffPrompt` | Copies a prompt that tells the target agent to read the target session's handoff file, creating it first if needed. |
| Copy Handoff File Path to Clipboard | `codexHistoryViewer.copyHandoffPath` | Copies the full path of an active target session's handoff file, creating or refreshing the file first if needed. |
| Open Handoff File | `codexHistoryViewer.openSessionHandoff` | Opens the target session's handoff file, with an option to create it if it does not exist. |

## Tag Operations

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |

| Bulk Rename Tag... | `codexHistoryViewer.renameTagGlobally` | Renames one tag across all annotated sessions. |
| Bulk Delete Tags... | `codexHistoryViewer.deleteTagsGlobally` | Removes selected tags across all annotated sessions. |

## Project Associations

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Association... | `codexHistoryViewer.manageProjectAssociation` | Selects a project and manages its workspace or project association, display mode, and association target. |
| Clear Project Association... | `codexHistoryViewer.clearProjectAssociation` | Selects a project and removes its applicable project association after confirmation. |

## Import and Export

| Command (EN label) | Command ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Export Sessions... | `codexHistoryViewer.exportSessions` | Exports selected original session data with extension metadata, or exports sanitized Markdown. |
| Import Sessions... | `codexHistoryViewer.importSessions` | Restores Codex or Claude Code session data from a selected directory and restores accompanying metadata when a valid export manifest is available, with selectable restore scope and duplicate-ID handling. |

Original-data export and import support Codex `.jsonl.zst` histories and preserve their compressed format. When overwriting a history stored in the other format, import converts the incoming data to the destination's format before replacing it. Markdown export reads either format and writes a readable transcript.
