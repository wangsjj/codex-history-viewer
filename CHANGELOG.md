# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Added experimental support for compressed Codex histories (`.jsonl.zst`). Disabled by default.
- Added **Compression** to the History pane's **...** menu and filter picker.
- Added an option to save search queries together with their filters as search presets.
- Added a **File AI Change History** icon to diff cards in the Session Viewer, opening the file's history at the selected change.

### Changed

- Consolidated Command Palette entries for History and Pinned display and filtering into **Filter...**, **Change Sort Order...**, and **Change Presentation...** commands for each view.
- Added support for importing and exporting compressed histories.
- Updated the bundled KaTeX to 0.18.9 and DOMPurify to 3.4.16, along with related dependencies and build tools.

### Fixed

- Fixed the beginning of long Codex histories sometimes being missing when restoring an open session after restarting VS Code. If a referenced history cannot be read, a notice is shown regardless of the detail-display setting.
- Fixed Codex automatic approval review sessions (Guardian) being treated as regular conversations. They are now recognized as Agent Runs and follow the same agent-session handling as other agents in History, Search, History Insights, and File AI Change History.
- Fixed failed, interrupted, or unapplied Claude Code edits being displayed and counted as applied file changes.
- Fixed Claude Code overwrites of existing files being treated as file creation, resulting in incorrect diffs and added/deleted line counts.
- Distinguished unconfirmed Claude Code changes and excluded them from confirmed History Insights totals. Incomplete change records are now identified as such.

### Security

- Updated the Markdown renderer to `markdown-it@14.3.2`, incorporating upstream security fixes for excessive processing time in quote formatting.

## [2.14.2] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added a notice and a **Go to main history** button when editing a Codex prompt changes the session file. In the previous history, this action also replaces the resume button. After switching to the main history in the viewer, the usual resume actions become available. Auto-refresh and manual reload keep the currently displayed history.
- Added a **Terminal input** badge next to `user` in the Session Viewer for commands entered in Claude Code's shell mode.

### Changed

- Optimized session history reading to reduce processing overhead when loading and refreshing large histories.
- Improved syntax-highlighting performance when the same code appears repeatedly in code blocks or diffs.
- Codex prompt edits are now treated as updates to the main history of the same conversation.
- Branch Navigation now also shows histories before and after Codex prompt edits. Cards in the Session Viewer's history selector and previews show **Before edit** and **After edit** labels.

### Fixed

- Fixed Fork and agent icons disappearing after a Codex prompt edit.
- Fixed internal markup and `prompt` attributes appearing when viewing, copying, or searching suggestions for additional requests in Codex responses.
- Fixed metadata inheritance stopping after a previously processed Codex history was deleted.
- Fixed internal tags from Claude Code terminal input and output appearing in history titles, message text, and search results.
- Fixed Claude Code terminal output being treated as user messages and counted as user requests in History Insights.
- Replaced Mermaid's embedded js-yaml dependency with the patched 4.3.2 release to include upstream security fixes.

## [2.14.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- Improved History, Pinned, and Search tree construction performance for large histories.
- Made the dedicated settings page header more compact.
- Changed the dedicated settings page to show the results of settings export, import, and reset operations as standard notifications.
- Improved the labels and icons for code-execution and wait/result-retrieval tool cards.

### Added

- Added readable displays for questions from Codex and user answers.

### Fixed

- Fixed Session Viewer auto-refresh not running or resume controls remaining hidden after startup or window reload.
- Fixed an issue where changes to pinned sessions, annotations, and project aliases were sometimes not reflected when using multiple windows.
- Fixed some project alias changes being lost when aliases were updated in quick succession.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Added a completion-notification action that copies the generated handoff file's absolute path to the clipboard.
- Added turn timeline support for Claude Code sessions.

### Changed

- Reworked caching and history-reading paths to improve overall performance.
- Added support for newer Codex history records.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the same file could be counted and displayed more than once in a Session Viewer diff summary when it was modified multiple times within the same Codex turn.
- Fixed Codex token totals excluding cache-write input tokens or double-counting usage when durable and legacy usage records coexist.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Fixed missing file changes in sessions using Codex's newer `item_completed` / `FileChange` format.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Added support for Codex paginated sessions that use `history_base`.

### Changed

- Improved Branch Navigation terminal routes so a history that ends at a Fork point no longer repeats the shared message as a duplicate card.
- Updated the bundled Mermaid renderer from 11.16.1 to 11.17.2 and the Shiki syntax highlighter from 4.3.1 to 4.4.3.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the Codex running state and session auto-refresh could become stale when an active Codex session file changed without updating its modification time (`mtime`).
- Fixed Session Viewer resume controls briefly disappearing and reappearing during auto-refresh of the same session.
- Fixed large Session Viewer tabs recalculating their layout against VS Code's temporary narrow viewport when returning to them.
- Fixed unreadable text and lines in Light Mermaid sequence diagrams that use explicitly dark opaque `box` or `rect` backgrounds, without changing Dark diagrams, other diagram types, or Mermaid source.

### Security

- Updated the distributed Markdown renderer from `markdown-it@14.3.0` to `markdown-it@14.3.1`, incorporating upstream fixes for quadratic-complexity linkification cases.
- Updated the bundled KaTeX renderer from 0.16.8 to 0.18.5, incorporating upstream security fixes and hardening.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added a dedicated settings page organized by category, with User, Workspace, and Workspace Folder targets where supported. **Open Settings** now opens this page.
- Added a Maintenance page for scope-specific settings backups, cache and search-index rebuilds, cleanup actions, and access to the standard VS Code settings.
- Added independent settings for showing or hiding timestamps and project aliases or paths in History, Pinned, and Search session rows. Existing visibility defaults are preserved, and hidden information remains available in tooltips. ([#16](https://github.com/HizTam/codex-history-viewer/issues/16))
- Added a per-table action in the Session Viewer for copying only that table in its original Markdown form.
- Added support for Codex array-form tool outputs and standalone local-shell, web-search, and image-generation response items. Image outputs use the existing preview and save flow, and separately recorded intermediate and final images remain visible in history order.

### Changed

- Improved Markdown tables in the Session Viewer with clearer spacing, separators, wrapping, and table-local horizontal scrolling.
- Updated internal history and search caches and the Codex / Claude Code analysis parsers for the new formats. Existing cache and analysis entries are rebuilt once after updating, so the first history refresh, search, or analysis may take longer for very large histories.

### Fixed

- Fixed current Codex pasted-file references, including attachment-only requests, so they render as attachment cards instead of raw protocol Markdown while keeping only explicit user request text in the message body.
- Fixed Claude Code pasted text, automatically truncated long input, and pasted-image placeholders so verified records render as attachment cards across the Session Viewer and related outputs without changing Session Analysis matching. If prompt history cannot be verified, the primary session text remains visible.
- Fixed Claude Code peer and coordinator messages so they render as cross-session cards, remain searchable as assistant-derived content, and stay excluded from previews, Resume, Handoff, and human-message analysis.
- Fixed Claude Code scratchpad links generated as cross-drive relative paths on Windows.
- Fixed blank lines collapsing inside syntax-highlighted code blocks in the Session Viewer.
- Fixed Session Viewer resume and restore controls remaining hidden after session reload, auto-refresh, or initial background history refresh. After a failed refresh, the controls reappear only when the displayed session can still be verified.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Expanded syntax highlighting in the Session Viewer to cover additional code block languages and file types in file-change diffs.
- Added syntax highlighting to File AI Change History diffs when the language can be determined from the file path.

### Fixed

- Fixed in-page search in syntax-highlighted code blocks and file-change diffs so phrases spanning multiple highlighted tokens can be found correctly.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Added the ability to hide or show one or multiple sessions from History, Pinned, and Search.
- Added **Hidden Only** and **All** to the display target controls in History, Pinned, and History Insights, alongside the existing **Active Only**, **Active + Archived**, and **Archived Only** options.
- Added an action to the Handoff submenu for copying the handoff file path to the clipboard.
- Added file size sorting to History and Pinned, with the largest or smallest files shown first.

### Changed

- Updated original session data export and restore to include tags, notes, custom titles, hidden state, pins, and bookmarks for messages and other timeline entries. For Codex sessions, the active or archived location is also restored.
- Updated History, Pinned, and Search descriptions and tooltips to identify hidden or archived sessions.
- Reorganized the History and Pinned More Actions menus: sorting remains directly accessible, while secondary display controls are grouped into one-level submenus.
- Kept hidden sessions available in File AI Change History, as before.
- Updated the bundled Mermaid renderer to 11.16.1 and its DOMPurify dependency to 3.4.13 to incorporate upstream security fixes.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added rendering of fenced Mermaid code blocks as diagrams in the Session Viewer.
- Added a non-modal right-side pane for viewing Mermaid diagrams at a larger size, with fit-to-view, zooming, scrolling, drag-to-pan, and keyboard controls.
- Added Light and Dark display modes for Mermaid diagrams.
- Added saving Mermaid diagrams as SVG, PNG, or Mermaid source (`.mmd`).
- Added rendering of GFM task lists in the Session Viewer, with `[ ]` and `[x]` states displayed as read-only checkboxes.
- Added session file sizes to History and Pinned tooltips when Tooltip Mode is set to Compact or Detailed.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Clarified the **Preview: Max Messages** setting description to explain that it controls the maximum number of messages collected for detailed tooltips, rather than the number of messages guaranteed to be displayed, and that VS Code limits tooltip height to approximately 50% of the window.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where session tooltips could flicker when they appeared under the mouse pointer while **Tooltip Mode** was set to **Detailed**.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Added support for preparing CLI commands to resume Codex and Claude Code sessions.
- Added separate settings for selecting the resume method for Codex and Claude Code. Each can be set to Extension, CLI, or Extension and CLI.
- Added the session ID and session file name to the Session Viewer, with actions to copy the session ID, copy the full session file path, and reveal the file in its containing folder.
- Added a **Session Information** submenu to the History, Pinned, and Search context menus for copying the session ID, copying the session file path, and revealing the file in its containing folder.

### Changed

- Updated the Session Viewer resume button to use the selected resume method.
- Updated the History, Pinned, and Search context menus to follow the resume method settings.
- Changed Markdown transcript tabs to use the session display title (`<session title>.md`) instead of the generic `session.md` label. Markdown export filenames are unchanged.
- Standardized user-facing terminology to use Codex, Claude Code, and Session Viewer consistently.

### Fixed

- Fixed session context-menu actions after a reload so resume actions, CLI resume-command preparation, **Handoff to Other AI**, and **Session Information** work on the right-clicked session without requiring it to be selected first.
- Fixed session deletion so it cannot use a selection from another view or an unrelated row. A multi-selection is used only when it belongs to the same view and includes the right-clicked row.
- Fixed History, Pinned, and Search multi-selection so Codex and Claude Code sessions remain selected together when using Ctrl/Cmd or Shift, including ranges that cross source types.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Renamed **Open Session in New Tab** to **Open Session in Dedicated Tab** to clarify that the session remains assigned to that tab. Dedicated tabs now use a filled source icon so they can be distinguished from the reusable session tab in both light and dark themes.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where selecting a session already open in a dedicated tab could also open it in the reusable tab, resulting in the same session appearing in two tabs.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added History Insights for sessions matching the current History filters, with overview metrics, an activity heatmap, breakdowns by source, model, project, and tool, the most active sessions, frequently changed files, usage details covering input caching and reasoning, message composition, turn states, and changed file types, plus data quality information.
- Added Agent Runs, which currently supports Codex sessions only. It omits sub-agent sessions with an available parent from History while keeping them reachable through the parent session's Agent Runs panel, Search, and explicit Pinned entries, and shows parent, sibling, and descendant relationships in a right-side tree within the session view. Sub-agent sessions whose parent cannot be resolved safely remain visible in History. (Experimental; disabled by default.)
- Added Branch Navigation for switching between locally forked Codex session histories—including histories created with **Fork locally** or **Continue in new task**—and Claude Code histories created with **Fork conversation** within their respective session views. The route tree shows shared history, Fork points, and the start and end of each route. Codex Forks created in a new worktree are not supported. (Experimental; disabled by default.)

### Changed

- Updated the distributed Markdown renderer to `markdown-it@14.3.0` with `linkify-it@5.0.2`, while retaining defense-in-depth protections that disable fuzzy email and `mailto:` auto-detection.
- Standardized terminology across commands, settings, and documentation: the viewer is now called the Session Viewer, chronological content is called the session timeline, and individual entries are called messages.
- Session runtime context and local-command output are shown as collapsed cards instead of raw user messages.

### Fixed

- Kept seconds visible in completed and running turn durations after they exceed one hour.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Added an opt-in Codex session turn timeline, showing turn starts, turn ends, turn ranges, and running state in live mode.
- Added the `codexHistoryViewer.chat.turnTimeline.mode` setting to control the turn timeline. It defaults to `off`; `basic` shows turn boundaries, summaries, and manual folding for completed turns, while `live` also enables running-turn indicators, elapsed time, and update activity effects.
- Added manual collapse and expand support for completed turns.
- Added compact file summaries for patch group cards.
- Added an in-place **Open all diffs** / **Close all diffs** action for patch group cards.
- Added structured cards for Claude Code task notifications and raw `<invoke>` tool invocations while keeping internal IDs, local output paths, preambles, and raw notes out of normal views.

### Changed

- Improved auto-refresh `follow` mode and session timeline scrolling to the top, bottom, and latest positions.
- Improved File AI Change History in-page search result badges to show the matching card number and distinguish before/after diff lines.

### Fixed

- Hardened turn timeline edge cases for clock skew, compact duration formatting, narrow running-turn chips, and sticky user prompt switching.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added dedicated request-interruption cards for Codex and Claude Code history.
- Added interruption details when available, including reason, duration, turn ID, rollback state, and rolled-back turn count.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Added sorting to the History view by started date, last activity date, and name in ascending or descending order.
- Added sorting to the Pinned view by pinned time, started date, last activity date, and name in ascending or descending order.
- Added workspace-scoped persistence for History and Pinned sort preferences.

### Changed

- Moved Pinned sorting into the More Actions menu and removed the pinned sort toggle from the view header.

### Fixed

- Improved History view selection tracking after changing the display mode or sort order.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Fixed cache cleanup so `Empty Trash` no longer treats the current history cache as a legacy file.
- Centralized current cache and search index file names to prevent drift between write paths and maintenance cleanup.
- Hardened history cache, search index, and JSON persistence handling so regeneratable corrupt files can be cleaned up safely.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- Added **Project Association** so history from another project can be linked into the current project view or grouped together as related projects.
- Added **List / Project** display switching and **All / Current Project Group** scope switching to the History and Pinned views.
- Added shared search history for global search, in-history search, and file change history search.
- Added search handoff from Search results into in-history search using the same query.
- Added more flexible query expressions, including regular expressions and exact matching, to in-history search and file change history search.
- Added search history suggestions, selection, and deletion to in-history search and file change history search.
- Added collapsible display for Codex memory citation information in the history view.
- Added a sticky current user prompt display at the top of the session timeline.
- Added project-association awareness to handoff generation so handoff content follows the associated project display.

### Changed

- Reworked project display controls in the History and Pinned views so display mode and target scope can be switched independently.
- Changed global search to follow the current History view target, including project scope, tags, Codex/Claude Code source, archive visibility, and date filters.
- Improved the global search input so manual search, rerunning from search history, and per-item search history deletion are available from the same QuickPick.
- Changed saved searches to store, display, and reuse only the search query. Role filters and case sensitivity are taken from the current settings when the saved search is run. Saved searches remain shared globally instead of being separated by project, and can be removed individually from the run QuickPick with a trash button.
- Changed the Search view so filter controls live in the History view. Search uses the current History target as its scope, does not generate results from filters alone, and only re-evaluates existing results when the History scope changes.
- Changed file change history so it follows the project-associated display when resolving related history.

### Fixed

- Fixed file change history search so “No more history” is not matched by page search.
- Fixed Pinned project ordering when multiple projects are updated at the same time.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added project aliases for project `cwd` values, stored in extension state without modifying Codex or Claude Code history files.
- Added project alias display across History and Pinned project headings, session descriptions, tooltips, filter summaries, Status, and Search scope/session display.
- Added Undo support for setting and clearing project aliases.
- Added an experimental opt-in **Restore Webview Tabs After Reload** setting to restore session and file change history Webview tabs after Reload Window or VS Code restart. It is disabled by default because VS Code can defer Webview restoration and may occasionally create duplicate tabs when the same history is opened again.
- Added rendering for Codex code review comments as readable cards in the Session Viewer.

### Changed

- Changed archive visibility summaries from `Location` to `Archive` to avoid confusing them with project paths.
- Improved in-Webview search responsiveness by debouncing search updates while typing.

### Fixed

- Preserved the in-Webview search panel width when the window is resized below 860px. The panel no longer forces full width or hides the resize handle in narrow viewports.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Added project display modes to the History view: No Project Filter, Current Project, and Group by Project.
- Added project-grouped History trees that preserve the existing latest-first and date-grouped layouts.
- Added independent Pinned project display modes, separate from the History project state.
- Added independent Pinned filtering for date scope, project, source, archive visibility, and tags.
- Added a Pinned source switch for All, Codex, and Claude Code.
- Added independent Pinned archive visibility controls for Active Only, All, and Archived Only.
- Added a Pinned sort mode switch between pinned date order and session date order.
- Added a Pinned clear-filters action.

### Changed

- Changed project matching to use case-insensitive normalized project keys across platforms.
- Changed History clear-filter toolbar behavior so the action remains visible and is disabled when no filters can be cleared.
- Changed project-mode toolbar icons to represent the current project display state.
- Changed Pinned archived-session visibility so it follows Pinned-specific source and archive filters instead of the History/Search archive state.
- Changed the Pinned archive visibility toggle to show as disabled when Pinned source is set to Claude Code only.
- Changed Pinned project tooltips to distinguish the latest pinned time from the latest session time depending on the active sort mode.
- Changed Search toolbar ordering so Clear Results appears before Rerun Search.

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex `# Files mentioned by the user:` blocks appearing after IDE context not being rendered as file-reference attachments.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Added a unified session attachment model so images, Claude Code documents, Claude Code IDE file and selection references, and Codex mentioned files are represented as `attachments`.
- Added Claude Code document cards for PDF, text, and generic documents, including on-demand preview and Save As support without sending embedded binary payloads to the initial Webview model.
- Added parsing for Claude Code `<ide_opened_file>` and `<ide_selection>` tags, rendering them as file reference and selection reference cards instead of raw inline tags.
- Added parsing for Codex `# Files mentioned by the user:` blocks, rendering mentioned Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, archive, text, and other files as file reference cards while keeping only the request body as message text.
- Added compact attachment cards with file-kind badges, kind-specific icon accents, tooltip metadata for paths / MIME types / sizes, and action icons for preview, save, or open.
- Added attachment indicators and localized attachment summaries to the session date guide so messages with images, other attachments, or mixed attachment types are visible from the timeline tooltip.
- Added attachment metadata to the search index, including labels, paths, MIME types, file kinds, and bounded text from Claude Code text documents.

### Changed

- Changed session timeline rendering to preserve attachment order while grouping only consecutive images into existing image groups.
- Changed Markdown transcript, Resume, and Handoff generation to use clean text plus attachment summaries instead of repeating raw IDE tags or Codex mentioned-file blocks.
- Changed search indexing to exclude PDF / Office / binary / base64 document contents and to avoid reading Codex referenced files automatically.
- Bumped the search-index internal file version so existing indexes are rebuilt with attachment metadata.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Added optional Codex `archived_sessions` support alongside normal Codex `sessions`, with configurable archive enablement and archive root path under the Codex source.
- Added archived-session visibility controls for History, Pinned, and Search views with Active Only, All, and Archived Only modes.
- Added archive-aware History, Search, Markdown transcript, and session timeline rendering, including archived location labels and archived visual markers.
- Added **Move to Archive** for active Codex sessions and **Move to Codex History** for archived Codex sessions, using the official Codex provider when available.
- Added filesystem fallback for moving archived sessions back to normal Codex history, including conflict-safe destination handling and Undo support for fallback moves.
- Added multi-select support for moving Codex sessions to archive or back to Codex history, with sequential bulk execution and partial-result notifications.
- Added archive-aware pin tracking so pinned Codex sessions can follow official archive/unarchive path changes by session identity.
- Added metadata relocation for archive/unarchive and pin reconciliation, covering annotations, bookmarks, and saved session-view positions when paths move.
- Added Status rows for Codex archived session count and Codex archived sessions root when both the Codex source and archived sessions are enabled.

### Changed

- `Sources: Enabled` remains the top-level source switch for Codex and Claude Code; Codex archived sessions are disabled whenever the Codex source is disabled.
- Moved `Sources: Enabled` to the top of the extension settings so the archived-session settings read as Codex child options.
- Improved initial history startup by showing a valid cached history index immediately, then refreshing local session files in the background.
- Archived Codex sessions no longer expose Resume or Promote actions; their primary action is moving them back to Codex history.
- Active and archived Codex context menus now show only the relevant move action, separated from custom-title actions and delete actions.
- Session Viewers for archived Codex sessions replace **Resume in Codex** with **Move to Codex History**.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- Added cross-agent handoff between Codex and Claude Code, generating per-session `handoff.md` files in extension global storage with transcript excerpts and recoverable file changes.
- Added the **Handoff to Other AI** context submenu with commands to hand off to Claude Code, create a handoff file, copy a handoff prompt to the clipboard, and open or create a session handoff file.
- Added clipboard-based Claude-to-Codex handoff prompts and Claude Code opening via `claude-vscode.editor.open`.
- Added handoff storage cleanup plus Status view metrics for handoff count and storage size.

### Changed

- Renamed the lightweight session resume copy action to **Copy Quick Prompt** and kept it separate from full handoff commands.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added bookmark toggles to history cards.
- Added bookmark and user markers to the date guide.
- Added a density-aware date-guide lens that expands crowded timeline regions, follows the original guide hover position, and uses the active lens item as the click target.
- Added an icon to the file-change history **Open in History** button.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added file-level **File AI Change History** for workspace files, available from the opt-in **File Change History > Explorer Context Menu: Enabled** setting, with source toggles, in-page search, paging, source-aware card navigation, and links back to the matching diff card in the original session view.
- Added history-view performance modes for large histories, including a simplified mode that loads heavy diff/detail sections on demand.
- Added the `latest` option to `codexHistoryViewer.chat.openPosition` so sessions can open at the latest rendered card.
- Added optional compact date guides for history and file-change views that can be enabled or disabled from settings.
- Added settings:
  - `codexHistoryViewer.fileChangeHistory.explorerContextMenu.enabled`
  - `codexHistoryViewer.chat.performanceMode`
  - `codexHistoryViewer.ui.timeGuide.enabled`

### Changed

- Custom title actions now use a shared QuickPick flow from tree context menus and the Session Viewer header.
- Codex `apply_patch` activity is now shown as diff cards when possible, while duplicate cards are avoided when matching `patch_apply_end` events are also present.
- Codex diff cards now aggregate repeated updates to the same file within a single turn.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Changed session auto-refresh `follow latest` scrolling to prefer the latest non-diff content card when trailing grouped diff cards are last. The bottom scroll action targets the latest rendered card.
- Changed search indexing for Codex `custom_tool_call` records so `toolCalls` and `toolCallsAndOutputs` include lightweight tool metadata such as actions, commands, files, and paths.

### Fixed

- Fixed session auto-refresh `follow latest` scrolling sometimes being overridden by pending card-anchor restoration or later layout updates.
- Fixed `lastMessage` session-view position saving and restoring when no message bubble is visible, falling back to the previous rendered message or the top.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added extension-local custom titles for Codex and Claude Code sessions.
- Added session tree tooltip modes (`full`, `compact`, `titleOnly`) so users can choose between detailed metadata and a one-line title-only tooltip.
- Added `codexHistoryViewer.search.indexToolContent` to control whether the search index stores message text only, tool calls, or tool calls plus tool outputs.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added `SECURITY.md` with the current security policy and guidance for the `markdown-it` GHSA-38c4-r59v-3vqw / CVE-2026-2327 advisory.
- Added localized initial-loading rows to the History and Pinned views while the first history refresh is still running.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Added collapsible assistant usage rows in the Session Viewer when **Show details** is enabled.
- Added helpful History empty-state rows for no-history and no-filter-match states.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- Added a session-tab auto-refresh button in the Session Viewer header, shown when the History auto-refresh setting is enabled.
- Added per-tab auto-refresh modes: off, preserve current view, and follow latest.
- Added automatic refresh for open session tabs while VS Code is focused, including background editor tabs. Only affected tabs are refreshed, and new or different sessions start with auto-refresh off.
- Added on-demand loading for session image data so large image attachments no longer need to be sent to the Webview during the initial session render.
- Added card-based scroll restoration when toggling session details on or off, including fallback to the next visible card when the previous card is hidden in summary mode.

### Changed

- Deferred heavy tool arguments, tool output, and patch diff rows until details are shown or a diff entry is expanded.

### Fixed

- Preserved session-tab UI state across reload and auto-refresh, including expanded cards/diffs, details visibility, diff wrap state, selected message, in-page search state, and scroll behavior.
- Reset session-scoped Webview UI state when a reusable session tab switches to a different session, including in-page search state, image preview state, and image data cache.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Added a History view mode switch between date-grouped history and a latest-first flat session list.
- Added opt-in automatic history refresh for local session file changes, with debounce delay and refresh interval settings.
- Automatic refresh is deferred while the History view is hidden or the VS Code window is not focused.
- Added image attachment rendering in the Session Viewer for supported Codex / Claude Code image data and local image references.
- Added an option to open sessions from the top or restore near the last viewed message.

### Changed

- Changed session-tab handling so session selection uses a reusable tab, while **Open Session in New Tab** keeps sessions in dedicated tabs and reuses existing matching tabs.
- Changed the Session Viewer scroll area so the fixed toolbar stays outside the scrollable content.
- Changed the settings display order.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added opt-in diagnostic timing logs for history refresh and search-index maintenance.

### Changed

- Capped the in-memory Undo stack at 20 recent actions to avoid unbounded memory growth.
- Changed history refresh to process session files with bounded parallelism for better first-load and cache-miss performance.
- Changed history lookup to use a `Map`-backed index instead of scanning all sessions.
- Changed timestamp handling to use the VS Code extension host time zone.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale session panels for deleted or missing session files by checking file existence before opening/reloading and closing missing panels on refresh/delete.
- Fixed delete Undo cleanup so temporary backup files are removed when Undo actions are discarded, cleared, or completed.
- Made search-index stale-entry cleanup explicit.
- Localized Undo notification labels and action names.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-20
